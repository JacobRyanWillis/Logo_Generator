# Logo_Generator

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to get more familiar with classes, constructors, Jest and inquirer. This application generates a logo based on the users input. This assignment was very helpful during our learning of OOP (Object Oriented Programming). I now have a much better understanding on how to manipulate objects and use them for the developers benefit.
